# Catching Subtitles

> [!WARNING]  
> The future of this project is pretty unknown. If the subtitles end up being added to ReIndev directly, there's no need to have a mod version, lol.
> 
> This mod is heavily WIP (Work In Progress) and lacks lots of features! However, the base part of the mod is finished and can be tested by now!

_Catching Subtitles_ is a FoxLoader (Reindev) modification that aims at providing subtitles functionality in the game.
In other words, it displays text for sounds during gameplay, which can be helpful for people with hearing impairments or who don't play with sounds on for some reason.

### Features:
- **Subtitles:** Yeah, the main part of the mod.
- **Direction display:** Shows the direction of the sound source.
- **Distance to the sound (configurable):** Shows the distance to the sound source (in blocks).
